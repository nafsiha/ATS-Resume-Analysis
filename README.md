# Why Resumes Fail: A Beginner ATS Resume Analyzer

This summer, after my first year finished, I spent weeks applying to data internships and didnâ€™t hear back from most. It made me wonder "Was it my resume? Or was it never even seen by a human?" 
This project started from that frustration and turned into my first professional data project.
This is a beginner-friendly simulation of how Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) work and why so many resumes silently get filtered out before they ever reach a recruiter.

# What this project does

- Reads and cleans raw resume data  
- Compares each resume to a real job description (JD)  
- Finds matching and missing keywords  
- Scores the resume based on relevance to the JD  
- Gives a friendly recommendation on what to add  
- Checks if formatting is ATS-friendly (bullet points, structure)  
- Shows how your resume ranks compared to others

# Sample Output

ðŸ“„ ATS Score: 4/10

Matched Keywords: python, sql
Missing Keywords: tableau, data wrangling, presentation, excel

Recommendation:
Resume is under-matching. 
Try including these key terms: tableau, data wrangling, excel

Format Feedback:
- No bullet points detected
- No 'Experience' section found

# Tech & Tools

- Python
- pandas, nltk, regex
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Text preprocessing (stopwords, tokenization)
- Basic scoring logic (overlap with job keywords)
- Friendly feedback generation

# Dataset Used

- Resume Dataset from Kaggle
[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/resume-dataset)

- Job description manually added (`job_description.txt`)

# Why I Made This

I wanted to get better at Python.  
I wanted to understand why I didnâ€™t get interviews.  
I wanted to turn something that felt bad into something that helps people.

This project is beginner-friendly, personal, and real.  
If you're also a student figuring things out maybe this helps.

# What You Can Learn From This Repo

- How to turn a personal experience into a portfolio project  
- How basic NLP can be applied to real career problems  
- How to write clean, structured code that gives human feedback  
- That rejection can be re-framed as analysis

# Whatâ€™s Next

Want to build on this?
- Make it a Streamlit app so people can upload resumes
- Add skill-category tagging (e.g., data viz, soft skills)
- Train a simple classifier for resume types
- Compare multiple JDs at once
